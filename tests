The "tests" directory does not contain a specific file, but rather a collection of test files. Therefore, we will modify the existing test files in the "tests" directory to fix the failing tests or test cases.

For each failing test file identified in step 1 of the analysis:
- Open the test file and locate the failing test cases.
- Modify the failing test cases to fix the issue. This may involve updating assertions, adjusting test inputs, or fixing any bugs in the test code.

Ensure that the modified tests cover all edge cases and provide extensive coverage. Create mocks or use sample data as needed for the unit tests.
